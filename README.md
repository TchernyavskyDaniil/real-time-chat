## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# You can not run this add in local. You should create your firebase (firebase -> init, check keys) 
Just look in website (Vue, Routing, Firebase)
```
